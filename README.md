# Simple IoT Tutorial Demo Device Code

Particle Photon demo code for the simple IoT tutorial.

## Setup

### Hardware

* 1 LED unit
* 1 220ohms resistor
* Particle Photon (or any [other](https://store.particle.io/collections/dev-kits)  Particle IoT device for prototyping)
* Breadboard
* Wires - Male to Male jumpers

#### Circuit Design

The circuit design of the setup.

### Software

To flash the code to the Particle Photon device, ensure that:

* you have an account on the <https://particle.io> platform
* you have a Particle Photon (or any [other](https://store.particle.io/collections/dev-kits) Particle IoT device for prototyping).

1. To set up the Particle Photon, read the instructions from [here](https://docs.particle.io/quickstart/photon/). This initial setup will register the device on Particle Cloud.
2. Instructions on flashing the code to a Particle Photon (via the Particle web IDE) can be found [here](https://docs.particle.io/tutorials/developer-tools/build/).

If you have another Particle device apart from the Photon, check the Particle.io documentation with regard to your specific device.
